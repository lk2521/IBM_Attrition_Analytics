# IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance

![]

## Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization and Predictive Modelling

### Introduction

This project aims to analyze IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset to understand the factors contributing to employee attrition and performance. The dataset provides various attributes such as age, job role, education level, and more for each employee. You can download this dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset?select=WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv).

### Setup and Dependencies

This analysis is done in Python, utilizing libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn. Ensure you have these libraries installed to execute the code.

```Command Prompt
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
### Visualizations

This analysis includes a comprehensive set of visualizations to analyze both numerical and categorical variables in the dataset. The visualizations aid in understanding the relationships and distributions within the data. Various plots such as box plots, histograms, bar plots, and heatmaps are utilized.

### Machine Learning Models

The project evaluates multiple machine learning models to predict employee attrition. The models employed include Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Machine. Each model is trained, evaluated, and compared based on their performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.
